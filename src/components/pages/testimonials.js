        review: 'Sandra was so helpful. This was the first time buying a dog and taking on such a big responsibility. She allowed me to come and visit the dogs before placing a down deposit. She answered all my questions with grace. Once I fell in love with this breed, I was able to come pick my puppy from the litter and begin building a bond from the start. My dog, per the vet, is in perfect help and I get nothing but compliments on my baby. I cannot wait to get another!!',

        review: 'Does this picture say enough? My son fell in love and that was the end of it. Sandy raises friendly and happy dogs. We could not have asked for a better puppy buying experience.',
